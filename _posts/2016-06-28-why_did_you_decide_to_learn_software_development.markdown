Back in the early 2000s, I always found Xanga fascinating. I would spend endless hours every night trying to build the perfect website. I didn’t know how to code, so I would copy someone else’s code and make minor changes such as the font size and color. I would copy from different websites just to get the format that I want. I always thought you have to be a math whiz or a genius to learn to code. Programming always seems like an unrealistic dream for me. 

Up until a few years ago when a job I was interested in opened up at my company. I emailed the hiring manager my resume. Unfortunately, I did not meet their minimum requirements – they require 5-6 years of SQL experience. I had none. I never even heard of SQL. Luckily, at that time my ex-manager was working in the same department and managed to secure an "informal interview" for me with the hiring manager. During the interview, they must have liked my personality - they decided to give me a chance. I was given a SQL handbook and was told I had three weeks to learn the material on my own. I knew this was my chance. During the next three weeks, I studied the handbook, googled reading materials online and watched YouTube videos. When the time came, I was given the same exam as the other experienced candidates. Even though I did not answer all of the questions correctly, they were impressed at how I was able to grasp the concept without any prior experience in such a short period of time. I didn't even have the application. I was given the offer. 

After this experience, I realized I don’t have to be a genius to code. Its hard work and focus. I might have limited programming experience but I am passionate about learning. Flatiron is a great start to make my dream into a reality.
